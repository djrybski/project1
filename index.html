<h1> My Love for Fishing & Technology </h1>
<p> I was always an outdoor child growing up. I would immerse myself in nature
 I was always in the yard digging up worms or catching spiders.</p>
<p> Eventually I got into fishing and my obsession with the outdoors skyrocketed.
 I was riding my bike out of my Southside neighborhood to the suburbs to fish whenever I could.</p>
<p> Eventually I got my license and a car. With this came more fishing.
When I was 17 I took a Computer Science class. </p>

<p> Like fishing, coding was a lot of problem solving and I loved that.
I realized that if I set my mine to it, I could bring technology & fishing together</p>

<p> I went away to college at Indiana Tech to play baseball and study computer science
 I chose Indiana because it had a decent program and three rivers to fish right by the school </p>
<p> Go figure fishing had a role to play in one of the biggest decisions of my life
 Once I realized that I needed to come back to Chicago, I knew IIT was the best option</p>
<p> I am working on a fishing App right now with another student I met here
I also fish the 31st Harbor every chance I get to sneak away between classes</p>
